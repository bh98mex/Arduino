# Arduino
Simple door lock security system created and programmed in Arduino.
Simple and effective, it allows further implementations such as bluetooth connection and mobile control.
The work document relates to the CW2 Folder, where the program has been created. 
Several files have been added in the repository, beside the main CW2, that contain software for simple builds in Arduino
